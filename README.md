# 🏠 Airbnb Data Analysis

## 📊 Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Airbnb listings data to uncover insights about pricing, room types, neighbourhood distribution, and review trends.  
The aim is to understand key factors affecting listing performance and pricing strategies across various regions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze how the **number of reviews** has changed over time.  
- Explore the **relationship between price and room type**.  
- Study how listings are **distributed across different neighbourhoods**.  
- Visualize how different **types of rooms are distributed**.  
- Examine the **distribution of listing prices**.  
- Perform **data cleaning**, including handling missing values and removing duplicates.  
- Generate **descriptive statistics** to summarize key dataset features.

## 🧠 Key Steps in the Analysis
1. **Importing the Dataset**  
   - Loaded the Airbnb dataset using `pandas`.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicate entries.  
   - Handled missing values using appropriate methods (mean, median, or mode imputation).  
   - Verified data types and consistency.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized listing distributions using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.  
   - Analyzed price variation across room types and neighbourhoods.  
   - Identified review trends over time.  
   - Generated descriptive statistics (mean, median, std, etc.).

4. **Visualization & Insights**  
   - Bar charts and histograms for distribution analysis.  
   - Boxplots for price comparison by room type.  
   - Line charts for review trends over time.  
   - Countplots for neighbourhood and room type distributions.

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Review Trend:** The number of reviews increased significantly over time, indicating growing platform engagement.  
- **Price vs. Room Type:** Entire homes/apartments tend to have higher prices compared to private or shared rooms.  
- **Neighbourhood Insights:** Some neighbourhoods have higher listing densities and price variations.  
- **Room Type Distribution:** Private rooms are the most common, followed by entire homes.  
- **Price Distribution:** The majority of listings fall within a moderate price range, with few high-priced outliers.
